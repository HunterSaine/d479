        <h3>Transportation</h3>
        <p>Taniti is primarily accessible by air, with a small cruise ship making weekly one-night stops in Yellow
            Leaf Bay. The island is served by a well-equipped airport that caters to small jets and propeller
            planes, with an expansion underway to accommodate larger jets in the coming years.</p>
        <p>Getting around Taniti is a breeze. Public buses operate within Taniti City from 5 am to 11 pm daily.
            Private buses service the outlying areas. Taxis are readily available in Taniti City, and car rentals
            can be arranged through a local agency near the airport. Biking is a popular option, with helmets
            mandatory by law. Helmets and bikes can be rented from several vendors scattered throughout the island.
            Taniti City itself is known for being flat and easily walkable. Many tourist accommodations are
            concentrated around Merriton Landing, making it a pedestrian-friendly paradise.</p>
