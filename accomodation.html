    <h3>Transportation</h3>
    <p>Taniti is primarily accessible by air, with a small cruise ship making weekly one-night stops in Yellow
        Leaf Bay [1]. The island is served by a well-equipped airport that caters to small jets and propeller
        planes, with an expansion underway to accommodate larger jets in the coming years [1].</p>
    <p>Getting around Taniti is a breeze. Public buses operate within Taniti City from 5 am to 11 pm daily [1].
        Private buses service the outlying areas. Taxis are readily available in Taniti City, and car rentals
        can be arranged through a local agency near the airport [1]. Biking is a popular option, with helmets
        mandatory by law. Helmets and bikes can be rented from several vendors scattered throughout the island
        [1]. Taniti City itself is known for being flat and easily walkable [1]. Many tourist accommodations are
        concentrated around Merriton Landing, making it a pedestrian-friendly paradise [1].</p>
