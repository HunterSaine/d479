    <h3>Entertainment</h3>
    <p>Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and to visit the volcano. However, there
        are other things to do, including visiting a local history museum, going on chartered fishing tours, snorkeling,
        zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting several pubs, including a microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club,
        seeing a movie, taking helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art galleries, and bowling. Also, a
        nine-hole golf course should be operational by next year. Many of these activities are located in Merriton
        Landing, which is a rapidly developing area on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay. </p>
